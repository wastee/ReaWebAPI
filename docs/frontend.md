# Web Runtime v1 and frontend resources

**English** | [简体中文](frontend.zh-CN.md) · [Host API](host-api.md)

The **Web Runtime v1** contract defines browser capabilities, resource loading and storage. Its version is independent of the extension version. JavaScript calls the 730 standard REAPER 7.80 APIs through Promises.

## WebView Color Profile

**REAPER Preferences > Plug-ins > ReaWebAPI** opens **ReaWebAPI settings**. **Use sRGB for WebView rendering on Windows** is unchecked by default, preserving WebView and system color management. On Windows, checking it requests a fixed sRGB display profile to reduce UI color differences from REAPER and ReaImGui. **Restore defaults** clears the checkbox. Apply/OK saves the change, and Cancel discards unapplied changes, including Restore defaults.

| Platform | Backend | sRGB override |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | WebView2 | Passes `--force-color-profile=srgb` when creating the shared browser environment. Applies to all ReaWebAPI App and development WebViews. |
| macOS | WKWebView | No equivalent public API. The control is disabled and native color management remains active. |
| Linux | WebKitGTK 4.1 | No equivalent public API. The control is disabled and native color management remains active. |

On Windows, Apply/OK saves `[ReaWebAPI] WebViewColorProfile=Default|sRGB` in `ReaWebAPI.ini` in the REAPER resource directory. Restart REAPER after changing it. Reloading a page or reopening an App does not apply a pending change. The existing shared browser data directory is retained.

The Windows override uses a [WebView2 browser flag](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/concepts/webview-features-flags), whose behavior and availability may change with the runtime. Host environment or registry overrides can take precedence. It does not change the monitor's ICC profile, HDR configuration or other plug-ins. It cannot guarantee identical physical colors on every display. [WKWebView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview) and [WebKitGTK settings](https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/stable/class.Settings.html) provide no matching per-WebView display-profile setting. This release does not implement an override for those backends.

## Plain Web Apps

Docked and floating WebViews synchronize their native resize background with an opaque CSS canvas background on `html`, or on `body` when propagated to the canvas. Root/body attribute changes, stylesheet loads and style-node changes, viewport resizing and system color-scheme changes refresh this color. Transparent or translucent canvas backgrounds retain the browser's white fallback. Background images and gradients remain browser-rendered. No App-side resize handler is required.

Use ordinary HTML, CSS and JavaScript directories. No bundler or npm is required:

```text
MyApp/
  Open.lua
  index.html
  app.js
  ui.js
  style.css
  data/config.json
  images/
```

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">
<script type="module" src="./app.js"></script>
```

```js
import { render } from './ui.js';
const config = await (await fetch('./data/config.json')).json();
localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');
await reaper.lifecycle.ready;
const track = await reaper.GetTrack(0, 0);
render(config, track);
```

The [unbundled check App](../runtime/web-runtime/README.md) demonstrates modules, local fetch, browser storage, Canvas, file objects, DOM drop events and Workers. Run its `Open.lua` in REAPER. The extension injects the bridge into the top-level page; do not import `reaper.js`.

## Guaranteed baseline and optional capabilities

The v1 support contract is the required column below, on supported and maintained platform WebViews. Engine-specific new JavaScript syntax and every API that happens to be exposed are not part of this baseline.

| Capability | v1 contract | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTML5, CSS, ES6+, DOM/events, Promise, async/await, JSON | Required | Native browser implementation; advanced/new features still need feature detection |
| ES modules, static/dynamic imports | Required | Relative URLs, valid JavaScript MIME, no build step required; bare package imports need an import map or build |
| Local `fetch` | Required | Read resources within the App root; JSON/text/ArrayBuffer; missing files return 404 |
| Timers, requestAnimationFrame | Required | Normal browser throttling applies in hidden/minimized windows; not an audio clock |
| Canvas 2D | Required | Native browser context |
| localStorage | Required | Persistent storage isolated by origin in the shared profile; native quota/errors apply |
| File, Blob, FileReader, ArrayBuffer | Required | Browser file objects; arbitrary disk access uses host file APIs |
| Standard DOM Drag & Drop | Required | Handle `dragover`/`drop` and `DataTransfer`; does not imply a REAPER-to-OS native drag export API |
| External HTTP/HTTPS fetch, WebSocket | Optional | Remote CORS, certificates, CSP, network and browser restrictions apply; no native proxy or CORS bypass |
| IndexedDB, classic Worker, module Worker | Optional | Use feature detection and handle runtime errors/quotas |
| WebGL | Optional | Depends on browser, GPU, driver and session |
| Bridge calls inside Workers/iframes | Not supplied | Send Worker messages to the top-level page and call `reaper` there |

No special support is added for Service Worker, PWA, push, geolocation, camera, microphone, WebRTC, payment, Bluetooth or USB. An engine may expose some constructors; that is not a ReaWebAPI support promise. Node.js/npm/Electron APIs are not part of the runtime.

## Resource origin and storage

`reaper.window.open(path)` accepts a local HTML path. Its canonical parent directory is the **App root**. Production pages use `reaweb://<appId>/<entry>` without a TCP listener. WebView2 custom schemes, WKURLSchemeHandler and WebKitGTK URI handlers serve read-only resources. Relative URLs, ES modules, local fetch, Unicode/space/#/% names, MIME, HEAD and single byte ranges are supported. Encode `#` and `%` in resource URLs, for example `file%23%25.js`. Directory listing, writes, traversal and symlinks/junctions outside the root are rejected.

Define a stable, globally unique `id` in the root's `app.json`:

```json
{ "id": "timefold", "name": "TimeFold", "version": "1.0.5" }
```

This produces `reaweb://timefold/index.html`, and `reaper.app.getId()` returns `timefold`. IDs contain only lowercase ASCII `a-z`, `0-9` and `-`. Display names and directory names do not define identity. Assign a new ID when copying a template to create a different App.

When `id` is absent, pass the launcher's own `debug.getinfo(1, "S").source` as `ReaWeb_Open`'s `instanceKey`. The launcher filename loses `.lua`, becomes lowercase, and separators become `-`: `zaibuyidao_ReaGBA.lua` produces `zaibuyidao-reagba`. Launchers are never discovered by scanning directories. Without a manifest ID or a valid launcher source, opening fails with `APP_ID_REQUIRED`. Windows opened by an App inherit its launcher source, while their own manifest ID takes precedence.

Two existing roots cannot bind the same ID, even after closing their windows. The second root fails with `APP_ID_CONFLICT`. Moving or renaming the original root preserves identity when its old path no longer exists. Changing an ID creates a different origin and data directory.

All Apps share the existing browser profile. localStorage and IndexedDB are isolated by `reaweb://<appId>` and persist across restarts. Cookie behavior remains native to each engine. Custom schemes may not support cookies, so use localStorage or IndexedDB for persistent App state. Each bridge document retains its own handles and subscriptions.

```text
<REAPER resource>/ReaWebAPI/
  WebViewData/
  Apps/
    <appId>/
      origin.json
      Data/
      WindowState/
```

Windows shares one WebView2 Environment. Linux shares one WebKitGTK context and helper. macOS retains the shared WKWebsiteDataStore UUID in `WebViewData/`, with database locations managed by WebKit. `origin.json` schema 2 records the App ID, root and virtual origin, with no port. Existing schema 1 records at the same identity path can be upgraded. Old hashed App directories and browser data are retained, but HTTP-origin storage is not automatically transferred to the new virtual origin. Malformed identity metadata fails with `APP_ORIGIN_INVALID`.

Back up the shared profile and relevant `Apps/<appId>/` directories together. Normal browser quotas and user data clearing still apply. Development pages retain their explicit HTTP origin and create no production origin record. External Client listeners, configuration and authentication are independent.

Resource handlers reject foreign App authorities and origins without permissive CORS. The App root limits resource loading, not the trusted native API's filesystem privileges. REAPER calls continue through the existing main-thread bridge.

Capabilities and diagnostics expose:
`{ contract: 1, mode: 'app-virtual' | 'dev-http', appId, origin, storageIsolation: 'origin', localResources }`.
For production Apps, `origin` is `reaweb://<appId>` and `localResources` is true.

## Navigation

The entry document stays in the WebView on Windows, macOS and Linux. Blocked navigation to external `http://`, `https://` and `mailto:` URLs uses the same validation and system handler as `reaper.system.openExternal(url)`. This covers ordinary links and JavaScript redirects such as `location.href` and `location.assign()`.

Local `file:` URLs and other paths or queries on the App/dev entry origin remain blocked, with a developer-console warning. Use `reaper.window.open(path)` to open another local HTML document. Hash-only navigation remains allowed. Query changes still use the existing entry-document identity check. `window.open()` and links requesting a new window remain unsupported.

```html
<a href="https://www.extremraym.com">Open website</a>
```

```js
window.location.assign('https://www.extremraym.com'); // Opens the system browser.
await reaper.window.open('other.html');
```

## TypeScript and development servers

The [modern starter](../runtime/modern/README.md) supplies Vite/TypeScript as optional **build-time** tooling. Run `npm ci`, `npm run dev`, then `OpenDev.lua`. The default URL is `http://localhost:5173/`. `reaper.window.openDev` accepts explicit-port HTTP URLs on 127.0.0.1, localhost or [::1]. Start the server yourself. ReaWebAPI does not embed Vite, Node or npm.

Development App identities are keyed by the exact URL. Browser storage is isolated by origin in the shared profile, so different entry URLs on the same origin share storage. Use a stable entry URL and port. Hash navigation is allowed; navigation to a different document is blocked. Avoid entry redirects. HMR uses the browser's native WebSocket and has been exercised with Vite.

Run `npm run build` and `Open.lua` for production; ship `Open.lua` and `dist/`. The current template emits an IIFE and inline Blob Worker as one packaging choice; ordinary ES module Apps work as well. Both modes use native `fetch('./data.json')`. Native host file paths resolve from the local HTML directory (`dist/` here); a Lua-opened development page uses REAPER's Scripts directory. A browser fetch URL and a native file path are different namespaces.

A page CSP must allow its scripts/styles, `connect-src 'self'` for local fetch and the appropriate `worker-src`. The modern template's Blob Worker needs `worker-src blob:`. Development additionally needs its Vite HTTP/WebSocket URLs. Host clipboard and external-link helpers provide the cross-platform native operations.

Chromium DevTools also uses `connect-src 'self'` to read `/.well-known/appspecific/com.chrome.devtools.json`. The App resource handler returns empty settings when the file is absent. An App's own file takes precedence when configuring an automatic workspace.

## Platform backends

| Platform | Backend | Storage isolation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows x64 | WebView2 | Shared profile, distinct App origins |
| Linux x64 / ARM64 | WebKitGTK 4.1, X11/XWayland | Shared context and helper, distinct App origins |
| macOS ARM64 / Intel | WKWebView | Shared persistent data store, distinct App origins |

WebView2 follows the installed runtime; WKWebView follows macOS updates; WebKitGTK follows distribution packages. Linux needs its matching helper beside the extension. Optional capability behavior can differ with engine versions and graphics environments. HTTPS transport is delegated to the WebView; the automated network fixture verifies HTTP CORS and WebSocket, not arbitrary external TLS endpoints. DOM drop checks use synthetic events; physical OS file drops and real REAPER drag gestures remain manual acceptance cases.

Production origins use `reaweb://<appId>` on all platforms. Prefer `localhost` for macOS HTTP development URLs because ATS restricts IP-literal HTTP. See [Apple's local networking rules](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list/nsapptransportsecurity/nsallowslocalnetworking).

In the tested WSLg environment, WebKitGTK's DMA-BUF renderer stalled animation frames despite a visible document. Running the helper with `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` passed the full browser suite, including native requestAnimationFrame and WebGL. This is an environment setting, not a default forced by the extension or a JS polyfill. Validate the default renderer on your target Linux desktop; when affected, set the variable before launching REAPER. Native GTK viewport allocation is synchronized with the foreign X11 parent's client size.

Implementation: `src/web/web_resources.*` handles local resources; `src/runtime/runtime.*` owns App origins and the shared profile lifetime; `src/platform/windows/platform_win.cpp`, `src/platform/macos/platform_mac.mm` and `src/platform/linux/linux_webkit.cpp` select native profiles and load the entry; `runtime/reaper.d.ts` describes the runtime metadata. Tests cover the native resource boundary, all 730 mirror ABI mappings and actual browser behavior.

Native behavior references: [WebView2 local content](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/concepts/working-with-local-content), [WebKitGTK persistent cookies](https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/2.42.5/method.CookieManager.set_persistent_storage.html). Native cookie persistence is explicitly enabled on Linux.
